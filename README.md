Call center theme. 
The call center has a given number of operators and a certain capacity for clients; 
it is necessary to organize the emulation of the call center, i.e. conversation between the operator and the client. 
Those clients for which no operator was found should be placed in a waiting queue. And for whom it was found, they should have a conversation with the operator. 
Each action must be recorded and printed to the console. The call center must serve all customers and complete its work.
